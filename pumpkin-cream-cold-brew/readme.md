# Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew

Are you a fall-o-holic like me? Do you mark your calendar each year for the arrival of Papa Starbuck's gloriuos pumpkin-pie-inspired beverages? Do you wish you could maybe not blow an entire month's salary on this indulgence? If so, you've come to the right place.

Full disclosure, this is not a coffee recipe. I don't care how you make your cold brew, or if you use plain iced coffee, or if you buy it in a jug at the grocery store. You do you. This is how I make the creamy mixture that I add to my coffee that gets it where it needs to be.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup cold brew coffee
- 1/2 cup milk
  - I prefer whole, though I'm told skim froths better
- 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
  - You can buy this or make your own. I had other spices on hand, so I followed [this recipe](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/20476/pumpkin-spice/) and made about 4x to keep it on hand.
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon maple syrup
  - You can use another sweetener if you'd like. I wouldn't recommend fake syrup as it's a bit too thick and goopy, but real maple works wonders here for me.
  - Adjust amount to taste. 1/2 teaspoon won't be quite as sweet as you get from the coffee shop, but that's how I like it.
- Salt to taste
  - I recommend you start with no salt and add it one tiny pinch at a time. It's easy to overdo the salt, and you really don't need that much at all.
  - Don't use that thick crystal sea salt. It may be fancy, but it'll just sink to the bottom and make you sad as you finish your beverage.

## Instructions

- Combine everything except for the coffee and a tiny bit of pumpkin pie spice for garnish
- Froth the milk using a frother if you have one.
  - If you don't have a frother (like me), you can get a pretty good creamy consistency by pouring the mixture into a mason jar (or similar recepticle with a lid) and shake the hell out of it for 30 seconds or so.
  - This is a good time to taste your mixture to see if it's got enough sweetness or salt for your taste. Adjust as needed and mix/froth until you're good.
- Pour the mixture into your coffee, sprinkle with the remaining spice mixture, and enjoy!

## Other Notes

- Feel free to add a tiny bit of roasted pumpkin or canned pumpkin if you want. I don't really think it's necessary, but it does taste more like a pumpkin if that's what you're going for.
- Agave nectar might be a good sub for the syrup. Granulated or brown sugar is probably fine too. I haven't tried those, but use what you have and make it your own!

Happy fall, friends üçÅ
