# Buttermilk-Brined Fried Chicken

This chicken is seriously delicious, but you need to prep at least a day in advance. Don't rush it or you may as well just go to KFC.

## Ingredients
- Seasoning (adjust to taste)
  - 2 tbsp. paprika
  - 1 tbsp. fresh cracked black pepper
  - 1/2 tbsp. salt
  - 2-3 sprigs of fresh rosemary
  - 1-2 sprigs of fresh thyme
  - 1/2 tsp. ancho chili powder
  - 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
- 3-4 lbs. bone-in chicken (leave the skin on!)
- 1 1‚ÅÑ2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1‚ÅÑ2 cup cornstarch
- 1 tsp. baking powder
- 1-2 lemons cut into wedges
- 1 egg
- 1 head of garlic, peeled and minced
- Peanut oil for frying

## Instructions
- Mince your garlic, chop your fresh herbs, crack your pepper, and cut your lemons.
- Mix together all of your seasoning ingredients. In a large deep bowl, add a healthy spoonful of the seasoning mixture and whisk in the egg and buttermilk. Store the rest of your seasoning in tupperware for the next day.
- Add the chicken, cut up lemons and minced garlic to the bowl, making sure all pieces are submerged as much as possible. Cover with seran wrap and keep refrigerated overnight. You may want to give the bowl and nice shake a few times to keep the seasoning well distributed. If you don't have enough room in the fridge for the bowl you can also use a large ziploc bag, though I find the bowl to be easier and less messy.
- The next day, pull your chicken from the fridge. Remove it from the brine and let it breathe for about an hour at room temperature. I usually use a cookie cooling rack over a baking sheet to catch the drippings. Sprinkle a pinch of salt on each side before coating with batter, and don't throw out the brine just yet.
- While the chicken sits, it's time to prep your batter! Mix the rest of your seasoning with your flour, baking powder and cornstarch.
- Preheat your oven to 300¬∫ F. Heat peanut oil in a large cast iron skillet to around 400¬∫ F.
- One by one, dip a piece of chicken once in the brine mixture and coat each side in the dry batter, then drop it in the skillet. Don't overfill the skillet. The temperature of the oil should drop quickly when the chicken hits, but you want to try and maintain it at around 300¬∫ F throughout the cook. Flip the chicken with tongs to cook each side.
- When each side of chicken is a nice golden brown and the internal temp is around 150¬∫, remove it from the oven and place it back on the the cooling rack nestled in the baking sheet. You'll finish the chicken in the oven until the internal temp hits a safe 165¬∫ F.

## Other Notes
- Preferred flour: King Arthur unbleached all-purpose
- You can sub out the peanut oil for vegetable oil in a pinch, but I don't recommend it
- Experiment with the seasoning mixture, this is where you get to make the recipe your own
- Like your chicken spicy? Add some good hot sauce to the brine for extra üî•
