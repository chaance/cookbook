I'm not from the mediterranean so don't yell at me if this isn't culturally accurate. I just really like eggs and tomatoes and spices.

## Ingredients

- 1 yellow onion, sliced thin
- 1 cubanelle pepper, sliced thin (bell pepper works too)
- 1 28 oz. can of whole tomatoes
- 1/2 head of garlic, peeled and minced
- 6 eggs
- Spice mixture
  - 1 tsp paprika
  - 1/2 tsp coriander
  - 1/2 tsp turmeric
  - 1/2 tsp cumin
  - Pinch of saffron
  - Salt and pepper to taste
- Feta for topping
- Chopped parsley for topping
- Olive oil for the pan
- **Optional:** mediterranean meatballs
  - I'll add another recipe for this later, but generally it's beef or lamb with a bunch of spices and herbs

## Instructions

- Preheat oven to 375 degrees
- Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat
- Add sliced onions, peppers (keep the seeds if you like it spicy) and a pinch of salt
- Cook down until veggies are soft and onions are translucent
- While veggies are cooking, chop canned tomatoes into small pieces. Make sure to save the juice!
- Add garlic and spice mixture, cook until fragrant
- Add tomatoes and juice, simmer until thickened
- If included, add cooked meatballs
- Crack eggs into the skillet, season with salt and pepper, and reduce heat to low simmer
- Cover the pan and cook until the whites are cooked
- Uncover, add feta and parsley, lightly stir and enjoy!
